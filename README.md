# School_Project

if for some reason, you have found this, this is my school project, i am making a scavenger hunt for my local air force museum. 

to run:

1) install [IP Webcam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam)

2) open IP Webcam and scroll to bottom and press start server

3) there should be a ip adress at the bottom, type that into `camera = Camera('123:456:789/video')` making sure you have '/video' at the end

4) run main.py, it should print 'cap' once it connects to the phone, you can now run the program like normal

im hoping to have ai to detext certain planes, all the ai stuff is tests
